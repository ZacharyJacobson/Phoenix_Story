A man was just finishing a drink at hi local Ratskeller.
It was a nice Summer day, so they had the Biergarten open.
He was enjoying a good pint of Fruh Bock when he decided to order a bratwurst.
He saw Mehlhase driving by in her Audi.
He always  goes to the baeckerei after drinks at the ratskeller.
So he decided to head to one while blasting some Rammstein.
